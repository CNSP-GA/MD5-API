# MD5-API

A very lightweight API that encrypts any text using the MD5 algorithm. Available at: https://md5.cnsp.ga

## How does it work?

On the client-side,

- Add whatever text you want encoded using the MD5 algorithm after the URL seperated by a "/"

On the host-side,

- The text is received by Express.js
- Encoded using publically available NPM Module "MD5"
- Displayed to webpage using Express.js
